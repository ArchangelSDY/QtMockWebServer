A mock web server implemented using Qt for testing H\+T\+T\+P clients. This project is inspired by the mock web server in project \href{https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/mockwebserver}{\tt okhttp}, with small changes to A\+P\+I names to make it a bit more Qt style. Thanks to their great work!

\subsubsection*{Example}

\begin{DoxyVerb}```cpp
// Create a QtMockWebServer.
QtMockWebServer server;

// Schedule some responses.
server.enqueue(MockResponse().setBody("hello, world!"));
server.enqueue(MockResponse().setBody("sup, bra?"));
server.enqueue(MockResponse().setBody("yo dog"));

// Start the server.
server.play();

// Ask the server for its URL. You'll need this to make HTTP requests.
QUrl baseUrl = server.getUrl("/v1/chat/");

// Exercise your application code, which should make those HTTP requests.
// Responses are returned in the same order that they are enqueued.
Chat chat = new Chat(baseUrl);

chat.loadMore();
assertEquals("hello, world!", chat.messages());

chat.loadMore();
chat.loadMore();
QCOMPARE(chat.messages(), QString("hello, world!\nsup, bra?\nyo dog"));

// Optional: confirm that your app made the HTTP requests you were expecting.
RecordedRequest request1 = server.takeRequest();
QCOMPARE(request1.path(), QString("/v1/chat/messages/"));
QVERIFY2(!request1.header("Authorization").isEmpty(), "Authorization header is empty.");

RecordedRequest request2 = server.takeRequest();
QCOMPARE(request2.path(), QString("/v1/chat/messages/2"));

RecordedRequest request3 = server.takeRequest();
QCOMPARE(request3.path(), QString("/v1/chat/messages/3"));

// Shut down the server. Instances cannot be reused.
server.shutdown();
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
